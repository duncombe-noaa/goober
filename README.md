A test repository

This is a test of the emergency alert system.

We make a change here, under duncombe/goober

Add some lines, make a comment or two.

## And add a subtree for testing

 A directory created, a few files added.



## Planning to Rebase

To see what `rebase` does we'll 
build in some changes and then branch. More changes  in  the upstream tree, and more in the branch. Then rebase and apply the changes.
